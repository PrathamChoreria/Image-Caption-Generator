# Image-Caption-Generator

Developed and implemented a deep learning-based image caption generator using Python and TensorFlow. The goal of the project was to generate
human-like descriptions for the images provided to the system. Performed data-preprocessing on the captions dataset . Used pretrained CNN model
for feature extraction from images. Tokenization and other natural language processing techniques were used to generate captions for images.
Conducted a comparative analysis of results between the GRU and LSTM sequence models used in encoder-decoder architecture of the model.
